Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java's syntax is similar to C++, which makes it easier for developers familiar with C/C++ to learn.

## Key Features of Java

1. **Platform Independence**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform that has a JVM.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. **Automatic Memory Management**: Java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation.
4. **Robust and Secure**: Java provides strong memory management and exception handling, making it robust. It also has a security manager to define access rules for classes.
5. **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreaded programming, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.

## Java Development Environment

To start programming in Java, you need to set up a development environment. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Download the latest version of JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and install it on your machine.
2. **Set Up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Popular IDEs for Java include:

   - **Eclipse**
   - **IntelliJ IDEA**
   - **NetBeans**

3. **Write Your First Java Program**: Create a new Java file with the `.java` extension.

## Hello World Example

Here’s a simple example of a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **public class HelloWorld**: This defines a public class named HelloWorld.
2. **public static void main(String[] args)**: This is the main method where the program execution begins.
3. **System.out.println("Hello, World!");**: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Compiling and Running the Program

1. **Compile the Program**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your HelloWorld.java file is located. Run the following command to compile the program:

```java
javac HelloWorld.java
```

2. **Run the Program**: After successful compilation, run the program using:

```java
java HelloWorld
```

You should see the output:

```java
Hello, World!
```

## Java Basics

### Variables and Data Types

Java supports several data types, which can be classified into two categories: primitive types and reference types.

- #### **Primitive Types**:

  - **`int`**: Integer type (e.g., int age = 30;)
  - **`double`**: Floating-point type (e.g., double salary = 2500.50;)
  - **`char`**: Character type (e.g., char initial = 'A';)
  - **`boolean`**: True or false (e.g., boolean isJavaFun = true;)

- #### **`Reference Types`**: These include objects and arrays.

### Control Structures

Java has various control structures for managing the flow of execution:

- **If Statement**:

```java
if (age >= 18) {
System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

- **For Loop**:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

- **While Loop**:

```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
System.out.println("Count: " + count);
count++;
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Java is an object-oriented language, which means it allows you to create classes and objects. Here’s a simple example of a class in Java:

```java
class Dog {
String name;
int age;

    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }

}

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Dog myDog = new Dog();
myDog.name = "Buddy";
myDog.age = 5;
myDog.bark();
}
}
```

This code defines a Dog class with two properties (name and age) and a method (bark). In the main method, we create an instance of Dog, set its properties, and call the bark method.

This is just a basic overview of Java, and there is much more to explore. I hope this helps you get started with your Java journey!
